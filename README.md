# Lab Report
Small bash script to create all the standard files for my lab reports.


For the moment all files has to be located in the folder ~/scripts/LabReport/. Then one can just add an alias like
alias lab="bash ~/scripts/LabReport/lab.sh"
This can of course be put in .bashrc for a more permanent solution

Then one can use it by running:

lab <name_of_lab>

The main file will then be: name_of_lab.tex
